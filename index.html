            <p style= "font-family: 'Courier New', Courier, monospace; color: brown">Web Developer</p>
            <p>I am a second-year undergraduate student at Iowa State University, majoring in Software Engineering with a minor in Cybersecurity.
                 My proficiency lies in programming languages such as Java, C++, and Python. 
                 I am very enthusiastic about exploring new programming languages.

                My primary objective currently is to secure internships in software engineering, web development, information technology, or data science. 
                By pursuing these opportunities, I aim to enhance my understanding and practical experience in the field of technology. 
                I believe that hands-on experience will enable me to expand my knowledge base and contribute effectively to the technological realm.

            <h3>Project 1</h3>
            <p>The first project is related to develop a single Web page using
            only two technologies: HTML and CSS. The project consists in
            creating a single web page with a menu at the top know as
            Navigation Bar. We have to include text describing ourself and
            text describing the project. Additionally, we need to include
            two images: one image is of ourself and second image is anything
            related to the project itself.</p>
